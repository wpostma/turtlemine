# Tortoise Redmine Plugin #

## Introduction ##

**TurtleMine** provides a plugin for Tortoise SVN/GIT/Hg for [Redmine issue tracking](http://www.redmine.org/).

Once this plugin is installed and configured you will have a new button in your TortoiseSVN/GIT/Hg commit window that will give you direct access to a list of Redmine issues that you can select to include in your commit message.

Additional features can be found in some of the sites wiki pages (see details below) or on the previous location for this project at: http://code.google.com/p/redmine-projects/.

_The next release (unless there is a need for a bug fix release) will be version 2.0.0.1 and will contain a separate UI to assist in configuration and provide more options and lots of new features. Thanks for your patience._
